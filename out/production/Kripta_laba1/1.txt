Some of the challenges of facial recognition in the visual spectrum include reducing the impact of variable lighting and detecting a massk or photograph. Some facial recognition systems may require a stationary or posed user in order to capture the image, though many systems use a real - time process to detect a person's head and locate the face automatically. Major benefits of facial recognition are that it is non - intrusive, hands- free, continuous andaccepted by most users. Speaker recognition has a history dating back some four decades, where the output of several analog filters were averaged over time for matching. Speaker recognition uses the acoustic features of speech that have been found to differ between individuals. These acoustic patterns reflect both anatomy (e.g., size and shape of the throat and mouth) and learned behavioral patterns (e.g., voice pitch, speaking style). This incorporation of learned patterns into the voice templates (the latter called "voiceprints") has earned speaker recognis classification as a "behavioral bisometric." Speaker recognition systems employ three styles of spoken input: text- dependent, text- prompted and textindependent. Most speaker verification applications use text- dependent input, which involves selection and enrollment of one or more voice passwords. Text- prompted input is used whenever there is concern of imposters. The various technologies used to process and store voiceprint s includes hidden Markov models, attern matching algorithms, neural networks, matrix representation and decision trees. Some systems also use "anti - speaker" techniques, such as cohort models, and world models.Some of the challenges of facial recognition in the visual spectrum include reducing the impact of variable lighting and detecting a massk or photograph.
